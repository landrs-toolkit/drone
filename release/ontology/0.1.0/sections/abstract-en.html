<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The DRONE Ontology is intended to be a light weight Ontology for drone operations constructed from Ontology Design Patterns connecting and aligning OGC and W3C standard Ontologies.
This ontology is developed as part of the Sloan Funded LANDRS project to advance UxV data interoperability. The Merology was extracted from the Semantic Science Integrated Ontology to provide a lightweight set of parthood relations. 
Contributions and Discussion Welcomed.
